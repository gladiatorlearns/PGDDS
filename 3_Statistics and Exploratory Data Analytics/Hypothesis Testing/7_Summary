Summary
So what did you learn in this session?

 

Hypothesis — a claim or an assumption that you make about one or more population parameters
Types of hypothesis:

Null hypothesis (H₀) - Makes an assumption about the status quo
                                     - Always contains the symbols ‘=’, ‘≤’ or ‘≥’

Alternate hypothesis (H₁) - Challenges and complements the null hypothesis

                                                                  - Always contains the symbols ‘≠’, ‘<’ or ‘>’

Types of tests:
Two-tailed test - The critical region lies on both sides of the distribution
                             - The alternate hypothesis contains the ≠ sign
Lower-tailed test - The critical region lies on the left side of the distribution
                                - The alternate hypothesis contains the < sign
Upper-tailed test - The critical region lies on the right side of the distribution
                                                 - The alternate hypothesis contains the > sign

Making a decision - Critical value method:

Calculate the value of Zc from the given value of α (significance level)

Calculate the critical values (UCV and LCV) from the value of Zc

Make the decision on the basis of the value of the sample mean

x
 with respect to the critical values (UCV AND LCV)
